# Adding localization
Create TextValues$ ($ - lang name), then go to https://github.com/ExcU101/Vortex-File-Manager/blob/master/ui-component/src/main/java/io/github/excu101/vortex/ui/component/theme/key/TextKeys.kt, here you can find text-keys, just set Theme class by theese keys and Text class with your localization, specialSymbol - variable for replacing extra data.
